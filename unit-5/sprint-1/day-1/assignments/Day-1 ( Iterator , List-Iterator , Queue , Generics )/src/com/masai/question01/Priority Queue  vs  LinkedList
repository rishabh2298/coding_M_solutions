Priority Queue() =>	#	It is used when we want to represent elements prior to processing.
					#	It does not contain any null value.
					#	If we want to add any object then that object class must implements comparable
						or comparator interface for sorting.
					#	If we call this queue by reference variable then it give unorganized order, So,
						to get organized way of queue we should use ( peek(), poll() and remove() )
						methods.
						
				
LinkedList() =>	#	It is a class of List Interface and it works on zero based index value.
				#	It is best if we want to add or remove objects in middle of list on frequently
					basis.
				#	It also implements Dequeue Interface after java 1.5v so it also use for queue
					operations.
				#	It is non-synchronized so it work fast as compare to synchronized classes.
