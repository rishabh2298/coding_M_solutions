        <h1> 'b' tag</h1>
        <p>
            The b HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface.
        </p>
        <h1> 'i' tag</h1>
        <p>
            The i HTML element represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the i naming of this element.
        </p>
        <h1> 'u' tag</h1>
        <p>
            The b HTML element is used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use b for styling text; instead, you should use the CSS font-weight property to create boldface text, or the strong element to indicate that text is of special importance.
        </p>
        <h1> 'select' tag</h1>
        <p>
            The select HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options.
        </p>
        <h1>'button' tag</h1>
        <p>
            The button HTML element is an interactive element activated by a user with a mouse,
            keyboard, finger, voice command, or other assistive technology. Once activated, it then
            performs a programmable action, such as submitting a form or opening a dialog.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the user agent
            runs on, but you can change buttons' appearance with CSS.
