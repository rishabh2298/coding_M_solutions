	#	Multiple Inheritance is a concept where a single class can inherit properties of more than one different 
		classes simultaneously. 
		But it is not possible in java classes it can be done only by interface where more than one interface can 
		extends in other interface and that extended interface can be implemented in child class.
		
		Suppose there are three classes A,B,C where A and B has same method with same parameters and both classes
		will be extended in C which will be child for both A and B,
					Now if we make a object of class C and call that method then complier will got confused and
		unable to decide that with which parent class method it should go and give an ambiguity error.
		
		There for  for these interface is introduced if there will be same method in different interfaces let's say 
		method of A and B are same and when we implement's it inside of class C then obviously it will be an abstract
		method so we have to implement it just once and it won't get any compile error.
