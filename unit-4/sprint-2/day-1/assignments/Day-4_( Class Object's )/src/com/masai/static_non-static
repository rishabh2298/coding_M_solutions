When we defines variables as a class instance member it is of two types:-

1. Static Variable :- # This type of variable will be loaded in the primary memory directly while
						calling the java application. As it is a part of context area.
					  
					  # This variable can be call in three ways :-
					  1. Directly by it's name.
					  2. By class name dot(.) than variable name.
					  3. By class object via referance variable.
					  
					  # This variable are available for all instance variable and methods.
					  
					  
					  
2. Instance Variable :- # This type of variable is not loaded in variable directly while calling
						  of the application.
						  To call this variable we have to create object of that class in which
						  class this instance variable is created.
						  This object must be create inside a method other wise it will give a
						  compile time error called StackOverFLow error. Because of loop creation.
						  
						# To call this variable we have only one option ,i.e. by creating object.
						
						# This class variable can be access in all methods only by referance variable
						  of that class.
						  
 Example -->   package com.masai
 
 		  class Main{
 		  
 		  	static int x = 100;      //  This is static variable (also called class variable )
 		  
 		  	byte y = 124          // This is instance variable (aslo called non-static variable ).
 		  
 		  	public static void main (String[] args){
 		  	
 		  	}
 		  	
 		  }
