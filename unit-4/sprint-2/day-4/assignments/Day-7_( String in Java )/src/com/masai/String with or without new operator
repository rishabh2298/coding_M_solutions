String Literal :- # This is simple way of creating a string object. In this JVM read whatever written inside double quotes 
					("").
				  # It will create a string object inside SCP (String Constant Pool) Area, if there is no object with same
				  	content available than only. Otherwise it will create a new object inside SCP area.
				  # If same object is already present then it will share the same object with all reference variable which 
				  	has same object.
				

String with "new" :- # In this content will add to SCP area by passing it through constructor. If there was no object with 
					   same content available. Otherwise share same object in SCP.
					 # But due to "new" operator a new memory allocate inside heap area and content from SCP area will be
					   copied here and this heap area object address will be saved inside our reference variable, instead
					   of object address of SCP area.
					 
					 		  
Example : 	String s1 = "Hello";    // here object will create inside SCP area and that address will save inside s1
			String s2 = "Hello";	// as this object is already created inside SCP area so it will share same object 
									   address. So (s1==s2) will be "true".
									   
			String s3 = new String("Hello")  // here it will a new object create inside heap area and copy the content from 
											    SCP area to the object of heap area. And address of that heap area object
											    will be saved inside s3. 
											    Therefore object address of (s1==s2) will true but (s1==s3) will be false.
