Instance Variable :-1.When declaration and assingment of variable is done as a member of class
					  and not a method, then that type of variable is called instance variable.
					2. This variable is non-static type variable.
					3. It will be available for all the methods and variables which are members of
					   that particular class.
					  
Local Variable :- 1. When declaration and assignment of variable is done inside a particular method,
					 then that type of variable is called Local variable.
				  2. This variable is non-static type variable.
				  3. It will be available only inside that method in which it is declared.
				  4. We can't use local variable outside that block neither as class member nor as
				     other method variable.

Ex :- public class Scopes{
			
			int a = 40;    -------> instance variable (non-static variables)
			char b = 'G';			
			
			public static void main(){
				
				int c = 80;   --------> local varible ( only availabe inside this method )
				float d = 50.9f ; 
			}
      }
