When we write java source code it get complied by compiler of Developer tool which 
is inside JDK into byte-code. There is software component JVM(Java Virtual Machine) 
inside JRE (Java Runtime Environment) which read this byte-code and run the main
method of that java .class files.
		As this JRE can be installed on different OS and it require only byte-code 
to run applications. So because of this byte-code which is a .class file our java 
code is able to run on different plateforms (OS) like Windows,Mac,Linux etc. and this
byte-code make WORA (Write Once Run Anywhere) concept which make our code plateform 
independent in the form of byte-code.

Java source code ----> compiler --------->  Byte-code -------> PLATEFORM ------> JVM ----------> OS execute application
