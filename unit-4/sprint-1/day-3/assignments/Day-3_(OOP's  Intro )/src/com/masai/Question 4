public class Main{
	
	public static void main(String[] args){
		
		float f=3.3;
		
		System.out.println(f);
		
	}
}

Explanation :- This code will give compile time error because of ( line-5 ).
			   Always when we initialize any decimal value than it is a double data-type value
			   by default and double is bigger than float so we have to do explicit type-casting.
			   We have to convert double to float than it will give correct output.
			   
			   
Correct  Code 
---------------

public class Main{

	public static void main(String[] args){
		
		float f = 3.3f;      -----> conversion from double to float by writing (f) just after value
		
		System.out.println(f);
		
	}
}
