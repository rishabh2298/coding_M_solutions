Wrapper Classes :-

	1.	For primitive data-type there are some classes predefined in java.lang package of java
		that classes is known as wrapper classes.

	2.	This classes has some constant variables like MIN_VALUE & MAX_VALUE with help of which
		we can get maximum and minimum (range) values of all the primitive data-types (except - 
		boolean data-type, as it has only 2 values).

	3.	In some cases we need primitive data-type in form of objects that's why this classes had
		introduced.

	4.	This classes also help in converting string numbers into specific primitive data-type.
		eg :- String s= "1000" ------>   can be convert to integer data-type via, Wrapper classes.
