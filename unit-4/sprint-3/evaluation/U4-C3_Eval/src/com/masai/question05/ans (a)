No this code will not compile successfully.

1. Because whenever we initialize any instance variable (as a member of interface) in interface then it will always be in 
   state of (public static final) means we can access that variable from class which is implementing it but we can assign 
   a new value to that variable as it is using "final" keyword which was assign to it by compiler.

2. It is trying to access that without creating object of child class. So also it wont be able to get access.
