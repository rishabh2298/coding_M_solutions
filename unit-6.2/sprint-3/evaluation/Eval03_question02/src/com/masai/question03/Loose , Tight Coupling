 Tight Coupling :-
 ================
 
 When an dependent class is dependent for object of dependency class and if by making any changes in the
 dependency class in future will force to do changes in dependent class means it will also affect process
 of dependent class then it is called tight coupling
 
 i.e. dependent class it tightly coupled with dependency class and if we do any changes in dependent class
     (like changing class name or method name or variable name then it need to do changes in dependent
     class also.
     
     
     
  Loose Coupling :-
  ================
  
  To resolve this tight coupling loose coupling was introduced
  
  According to this concept if we do any changes in our dependency class then it won't affect anything
  in our dependent class. Means there is no need to do any changes in dependent class and we can add
  more dependency dynamically.
  
  For this we use interface and implement that to all our dependency class and write logic in it's method
  which will be called form our dependent class.
