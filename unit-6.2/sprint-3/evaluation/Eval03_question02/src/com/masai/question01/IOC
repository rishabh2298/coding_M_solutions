 # IOC is stands for Inversion Of Control.
 
 # Usually when a class is dependent for object of dependency class then developer will create object
   of dependency class and provide it to dependent class to access data/functions of dependency class.
   
 # But if this process of creating a object and providing to dependent class is done by some external 
   entity class which in case of Spring is Spring container then this providing control to other is 
   called inversion of control.
   
 # So this IOC is responsible for creating bean class and provide this Dependency to dependent class
   by automating the process along with some other properties.
