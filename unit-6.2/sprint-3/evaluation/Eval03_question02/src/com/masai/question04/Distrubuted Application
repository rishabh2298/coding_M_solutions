Distributed Application
=======================

When an application is running on servers and taking thousands of client request (in enterprise applications)
then it is very difficult for a single server to handle such large no. of requests.

So to solve this what developer will do is either increase the specification and configuration of computers
on which servers are running or deployed application on many servers and this will handle thousands
of request by distributing it among themselves by load balancer



So this is called scaling of distributed application and it is of two types :-

1. Vertical Scaling => # In this specification of particular computer is increased on which application
					     is running on server.
					   
					   # It is good for smaller applications , But it is not feseable for 
					     larger no of request.
					   
					   # And also if server got crashed then it will be difficult so server for some
					     specific period of time.
					     
				
  SO for that other scaling was introduced.
  
2. Horizontal Scaling => # In this several servers are running on different computers  on which our
						   application is deployed.
						   
						 # If large no of request is come then with help of load balancer it will be
						   distributed among least request handler and by this scaling will become
						   more easier for maintain and handle.
