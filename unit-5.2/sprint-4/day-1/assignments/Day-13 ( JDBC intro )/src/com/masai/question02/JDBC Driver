JDBC Driver:-
=============

JDBC stands for Java DataBase Connection and every database software uses
.jar file for making connection between client software and database.

this .jar file is a zip file that contains all the files in the form of
.class which is class and interface required for making connection and
communicate among them.

for that we need to install required driver software from internet of
database with which we want to make connection

eg: mysql	= mysql-connector.jar
	oracle 	= ojdbc6.jar
	progress= progress.jar
