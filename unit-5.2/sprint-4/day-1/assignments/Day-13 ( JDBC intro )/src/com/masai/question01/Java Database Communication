Java database communication is required for making connection between java application and database
.So that data can be manipulated or updated from application which will increase.

for making communication we need to use jdbc (java database connection) driver which will come in
in the form of (.jar) file which is a zip file which contain all the jdbc api's that has classes
and interface by using which we can make changes in database.

for that we need to save path of jdbc driver of that particular database in our application.
