Benifits Multithreading:

# It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at the
  same time.

# Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread.

# It keeps our programme run fast and reduce idle time of CPU.

# With multithreading we can decrease our processing time.

# You can perform many operations together, so it saves time.
