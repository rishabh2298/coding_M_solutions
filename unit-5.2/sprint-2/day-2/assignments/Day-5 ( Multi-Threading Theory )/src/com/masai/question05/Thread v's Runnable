Thread Class => # This class belongs to java.lang package. And it contains several methods which are
				  operated by thread object.
				  
				# This class implements runnable methods and override's run method with empty body.
				  
				# This class has a non-static method start() which is responsible for calling run() 
				  method internally.
				  
				# It take class that implements runnable interface through it's constructor to create
				  thread for that class object.
				  
				  
Runnable Interface => # This belongs to java.lang package. And it contains only one abstract class
						public void run().
						
					  # It is a functional interface so it support's functional programming.
					  
					  # It's method will run by thread class start() method to run a thread simultaneously
					    with main thread. If we call direct run method then it will perform as a normal
					    non-static method.
					    
					  # To run a seperate thread it's method is very important and without run() method 
					    it's impossible to create and run seprate thread along with main thread.
