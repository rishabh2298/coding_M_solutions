Multithreading=> #	Multithreading is a programming concept in which the application can create a small unit of tasks to execute in
					parallel. If you are working on a computer, it runs multiple applications and allocates processing power to them. A
					simple program runs in sequence and the code statements execute one by one. This is a single-threaded application.
					But, if the programming language supports creating multiple threads and passes them to the operating system to run
					n parallel, itâ€™s called multithreading.
					
				
Advantages Multithreading:

# It doesn't block the user because threads are independent and you can perform multiple operations at the
  same time.

# You can perform many operations together, so it saves time.

# Threads are independent, so it doesn't affect other threads if an exception occurs in a single thread.
