Life-cycle of a Thread
======================

In Java, a thread always exists in any one of the following states. These states are:

1. New state => In this state a new Thread is declared and not start at this point.

2. Runnable state => In this state that declared thread is send to the thread scheduler for it's scheduling
					 purpose and there it is decided that when it will start performing and when to stop/wait.
					 
3. Running state => In this state that thread has been selected to run and perform it's task.

4. Blocked state => In this state the running thread will be blocked from running state either 
					conditionally (join), unconditionally (wait), for timed (sleep).
					
5. Dead state => In this state whole run() method will execute it's task completely.
