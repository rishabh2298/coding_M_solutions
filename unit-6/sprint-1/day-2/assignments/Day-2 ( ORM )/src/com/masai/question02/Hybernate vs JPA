1. 	JPA is stands for Java Persistence API's and It is a service API's provided by Oracle corps
	whereas Hybernate is a ORM (object relational mapping) software made by Hybernate organization.
	
2.	JPA is a collection of api's which is inside javax.persistence and all the ORM softwares are
	implementing this JPA and build their ORM software over it. So we have access on JPA from 
	all the ORM software.
	
3. 	If we write our business logic using JPA then even if we change our database it will be working
	fine but if we use Hybernate API's to write code then it is domain specific and we can't use
	other ORM because it will create errors.
