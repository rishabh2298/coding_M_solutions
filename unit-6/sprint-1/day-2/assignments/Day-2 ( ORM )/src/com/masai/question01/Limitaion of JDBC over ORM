1. 	JDBC don't allow java object directly into table because it doesn't take java object as it's 
	parameter.
	
2. 	JDBC code is database dependent and we can't use it for other databases as it's query is 
	database specific.
	
3. 	In JDBC we have write same code again and again only difference is the query that we are passing
	which make it a boiler plate problem. 
	
4.	JDBC throw a lot of checked exception but ORM throw only some of Runtime exception (unchecked).

5.	After using select operation we get ResultSet object which is not transferable and we have to
	take data from it only after knowing about result set operations.
	
6.	There is no caching and transaction management support in JDBC.
