1.	ORM can take java object and internally it will covert it to sql query and persist it in the 
	database.
	
2.	By using JPA we can make our application ORM independent and database independent so that it will
	run over any database and any orm software.
	
3.	It doesn't have any boiler plate problem link JDBC and has very less and clean coding.

4.	ORM doesn't throw any checked exception and throw some unchecked exception which need not to be
	handled.
	
5.	we can get java object when we make a JPA call to get data which is not possible in case of
	JDBC.
	
6.	There is caching technique which will make local file of our application and instead of interacting
	with database for every query it will save operation in caching and commit after some time which
	will save some cost for database interaction chargers.
