Java Build Process :-
==================

1. Model => In this we have to create all bean classes of class of which we want values.

2. Dao => Here we will create java files of interface and it's implementation part.
		  All the business logics of out application will be there in implementation class
		  
3. Usecases => here we will use those methods of dao implementaion class and input from user
			   and update record's and use methods accordingly
			   
			   
Using Maven :-
===========

1. By using maven we don't have to code completely because it will create some of auto generated
   code and make works which developer need's to do for every time repetedly.
  
2. By using maven cycle it will compile,test-compile , check our test case, then package all the files
   in jar files and save jar file (installing) to it's repository.
   
3. It has 3 repository
	A. Local Repository = while using any jar file by dependency it will check first in local repository
	B. Central Repository = if jar file is not found in local then maven go for central repository
	C. Server Repository = finally if file not found both in local and central then it will go for remote
						   (server) repository.
						   
4. If we are using maven which is a built tool if we want to connect with database it don't throw 
   much exception but it we don't use any built tool then while intracting with database it will 
   throw exception which need to handle for making our application work better.
   
5. This built tools help by providing some auto code generator and reducing again and again creation 
   of common code which developer need to create repeatedly.
