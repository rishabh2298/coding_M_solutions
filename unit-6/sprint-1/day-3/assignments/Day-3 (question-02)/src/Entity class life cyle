It has 3 life cycle stages :-

1. Transient stage :- If we create a object of entity class and this class is not attached
					  to any entity manager object then that state is known as transient stage.
					  
					  ex - Product product = new Product(10,"shirt",999);
					  
2. Persistence stage :- If a persistence class object is associated with entity manager object
						then this object is in persistence stage.
						
						Ex : if we use persist(-) method or merge(-) method then it is in persistence
						stage.
						
						when an entity class object is in persistence stage it is in-sync with 
						database and whatever changes made inside the transaction stage into entity
						object it will auto updated the changes in the databases.
						
						
3. Detached Stage :- In this stage the entity class object is detached from database by detaching the
					 entity manager.
					 
					 It is done by using method .close() or .save().
					 
					 If we use .merger() method to that detached object of entity manager then it
					 again came back to persistence stage.
